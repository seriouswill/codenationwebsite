                <h3>
                    Question 1:
                </h3>
                <p>
                <h4>What is the purpose of IT in modern business?</h4> Let's imagine a world before online
                shopping,
                stock
                tracking, digital marketing and credit card transactions. So, the 1960's basically. Well,
                it's
                2021,
                and
                unfortuntaely for your company's accounting department's (depending which way you look at it
                -
                job
                creation,
                revenue generators etc), all of those things missing from 1970 exist, and they are around
                for
                good.
                Or
                at least until the next apocolypse.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>But what does IT even mean anymore?</h4> No longer the moniker for the 'doss' about in
                school,
                the
                umbrella
                term of Information Technology can include a whole host of things. Especially when it comes
                to
                business.
                Want to maximise the reach of your services to people? You'll want to be investing in online
                advertising, digital marketing and the use of a broad spectrum of payment platforms. On that
                subject;
                taking card payments, or Paypal, even crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has now
                become
                a
                neccessity, even in person - in shop, or at the market. We are moving into a cashless
                society,
                all
                of
                which will require IT. Especially to make it safe...</p>
                <p>What's safer than cash though, right? Tell that to the fiver you left in your
                    recently-tumble-dried
                    jeans. Security and safety when using card payments, online payments, and payment
                    portals/wallets
                    all
                    need cyber security to make safe - and a heck of a lot of back-end development to access
                    the
                    correct
                    amounts of stock, the right bank accounts, and ordering/delivering the products.</p>
                <aside>We could go on, and on - but let's all agree IT is integral to a modern business to
                    make
                    it
                    in
                    any
                    way viable.</aside>

                <h3>
                    Question 2:
                </h3>
                <p>
                <h4>What on earth will we need to do that! </h4>So now that we've had a look at what types
                of IT
                relevent
                elements exist in a modern business let's get onto the methods, skills and resources we need
                to
                complete
                our
                digital projects successfully.</p>
                <p>Here we go! First of all let's implement some basic project managemnt to our process.
                </p>


                <P>Project overview: We are aiming to
                    achieve a dynamic, responsice site that is compelling and entertaining. The business
                    drivers
                    are
                    to
                    generate revenue, build an strong online audience, and to inform and entertain? The
                    benefits
                    are
                    that it is low maintainence, low cost and potentially high yield.</p>
                <p>Objectives: To build our site, with multiple responsive pages. To build a strong
                    online
                    following
                    and to develop a cool looking website for people to visit. If we can achieve our
                    main
                    objective
                    of
                    building our website, which we could call<strong>Stage One</strong>, we can consider
                    the
                    endevour a
                    success.</p>
                <p>Scope: As a solo project, all of the scope can exist within the parametres of my own
                    work
                    limit.
                    I
                    will use office hours, but also ad hoc time managment in order to prioritize
                    elements
                    should
                    they
                    become an obstacle. I will have the use of the cool cats at CodeNation, including
                    Jay my
                    python
                    tutor, to have a look over the work.</p>
                <p>Assumptions and risks: We can assume I have the knowledge in front-end development
                    coding to
                    achieve
                    this, the risks are that I foresee from the get go, are centred around the creative
                    ideation
                    elemnts
                    of this project: we want this site to be entertaing, engaging, exciting - this needs
                    a
                    killer
                    idea.
                    I have all the hardware, from laptops and chairs to achieve this, and have the
                    domains
                    and
                    offline/online storage to store and upload.</p>
                <p>Approach: I will cover this more later in my planning stages, but the implementation
                    of
                    Trello
                    boards, Gannt charts and time managemnt methodology will come into play.</p>
                <p>Organization: I, Caeser - am the sole member of this organisation. Everything rests
                    on
                    me,
                    but
                    that
                    also means I can implement my vision and change direction/overcome speedbumps
                    without
                    the
                    time
                    deducive element of people management.</p>
                <p>Initial effort, cost, and duration estimates: Effort high, cost low. Duration is
                    exactly
                    3
                    weeks.

                <p>Using our outlined plan from above it makes sense to get a Trello board on the go.
                    Please
                    find
                    the link to my Trello board <a href="https://trello.com/b/eLvD6Woi/wills-written-project"

                        here.</a> As you
                    can
                    see, I have used a KANBAN template to implement code <span>Review, Backlog, and
                        Testing</span>
                    alongside
                    your
                    traditional <span>Doing, and Done Lists</span> .</p>

                <p>Code: I have written most of the semantic HTML from scratch, using minor boilerplate
                    elements. I am also in the process of making the HTML accessible too. I have written
                    all
                    the
                    css, </p>
                <p>Style: Well, as you can plainly see I've gone all out on the stylishness of this
                    project. I
                    have
                    implemented intuitive color UX design, and drawn ideas and pallettes from CloudFlare
                    Design,
                    Adobe,
                    and other more nefarious corners of the internet. I hand wrote all the css from
                    scratch,
                    as
                    I
                    was a
                    little out of practive what with all this recent Python learning! </p>
                <p>Review: I shall be going over the code to make sure of best practice, that athere
                    are
                    repetitions and optimisizing where possible. I shall then ask tutors / friends in
                    the
                    web
                    design / development world to take a look!</p>
                <p>Interactivity: I am adding in elements of JavaScript to make the page(s) a bit more
                    fun
                    and
                    interactive! Stay tuned for more.</p>
                <p>Extra mile: If i can make it in time, I would like to add in the Trello API
                    interactivity,
                    whereby I can add things to my trello board from the page itself.</p>

                    plan. There is too much of a knowledge gap to be overcome by the usual methods of
                    research
                    and support.</p>
                <p>Time Constraints: The project may have a deadline that is impending, either from the
                    client,
                    or from external pressures. One might think of the example of a <a

                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">triple A game developer</a> who, due
                    to
                    marketing and distribution strategy have a set date by which they are committed to
                    go
                    live.
                    Whether they are able to push back this date is often subject to major financial
                    factors.
                </p>
                <p>Mis-management: The team, or sole member focus their time, effort and reasources in
                    the
                    wrong direction, or against the strengths of the members. Deliniation and delegation
                    can
                    be
                    powerful tools when implemented correctly.</p>
                <p>Technologies: There is an unforeseen breakdown between or within one of the
                    technologies
                    in
                    use. This can either be worked around, or it cannot. In either case this can be
                    incredibly
                    damaging for the business.</p>

                <h3>
                    Question 5:
                </h3>
                <p>
                <h4>CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON </h4> How would we go about choosing the right technologies for the
                job?
                </p>
                <p>This is a much simpler question to answer in our case. We are making a webiste. We are
                    unable
                    to
                    do that without HTML, CSS, and some elements of JavaScript. But the choices dont stop
                    there.
                    What do we need for our back end, if any? Well, it might make sense for us to continue
                    using
                    JS
                    or even python as we've been spending so much time working on it recently!</p>
                <br>
                <p>But often these days, independent or smaller developers use tools like bootstrap and
                    libraries to
                    develop even quicker! These options, even things like Wordpress can be great for less
                    experienced developers and regular folk looking to put together something for personal
                    or
                    SMB
                    use.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Most companies have a standard set of technologies they use. But they might differ
                    slightly
                    from
                    team to team. From production to quality assurance say. For major companies they will
                    have
                    to
                    develop over a huge amount of technologies. Let's take the example of a the good old
                    British
                    retailer John Lewis. They will have hundreds of pages that must be accessible over many
                    devices,
                    apps, browsers, all accessing the same database, visual content and interactivity.
                    That's a
                    lot
                    of code. and multiple languages.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We've an easier task though of course, and as a test of ability and in order to push
                    myself I
                    shall only be using HTML, CSS JavaScript, and possibly python - all written straight
                    into
                    vscode. No shortcuts.</p>

            <h3>Question 6:</h3>
            <p>
            <h4>It's Super Effective! </h4> The technologies I have chosen, specifically the ones I have
            leanrt
            and
            implemented on this course, i.e. python, draw.io, Trello - have had a varying level of success
            on
            this
            project.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Trello has been incredibly helpful. From start to finish, this wonderful Project Management
                tool
                allows the user to focus on the tasks at hand, whether creative or logic based, and takes
                the
                sting
                out of working through a problem bit by bit. Knbocking items off yuor checklists and
                priotising
                them
                accordingly. The Donbe section and code review have been incredibly helpful, both to see
                your
                progress thus far, and also to make sure you are on top of all tasks etc. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I have tried to implement my new found python knowledge into this page, but have had varying
                degrees
                of success - and whilst I undoubtably will b e putting them to good use soon enough, I have
                fallen
                back on trusty JavaScruipt in order to enable some site interactivity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In regard to the hardware I hvae used, and the software too - all has worked as expected with
                no
                hiccups! (Great news for a poor, independant developer such as I!) </p>

            <h3>Question 7:</h3>
            <p>So, There's this thing called GDPR - it's great. It's really great because it's there for
                everyones
                safety and protection.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2018, there was a piece of legistlation passed called The Data Protection Act, it was
                installed by the
                wonderful and now long lost ex-partner (BORRRIIIISSSSS!) of the European Union, and
                something
                that came
                along with that was the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and passed into UK law. It
                primarily
                concerns how companies handle your data. Whether they can store it, and how they can use it
                and
                whether
                or not you consent to that usage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now, on my website, and on my project, GDPR doesn't massively effect come into play - I don't
                have a
                storage of usernames and passwords, nor am I planning to collect any user data. When I
                implement
                cookies at some point in the future - I WILL - be implementing a cookie consent form the
                pops up
                when
                landing on the page.</p>
