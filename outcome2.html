                <h4> 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website,
                    are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello | </h4> I have used Visual
                Studio Code each day of the project and it has been absolutly vital! The extensions to help the flow of
                coding, the fantastic intuitive completion of words is very very helpful when writing out similar names
                for variables, divs, selectors etc.
                Trello was very helpful as a project management tool, I used it everyday and updated it as I went. It
                kept me massively on track.
                I used CloudFlare design pallete for my CSS styling originally, but I switched midway through the
                project to coolors.com pallete as it was more modern and accessible.

                <h4> 2.2 Describe whether the IT
                    tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello | </h4> I have been using VS Code
                for a long time now and i found it completely appropriate for the tasks I needed.
                Trello was a newer tool for me, but it was definitely appropriate to keep me on track and prioritize
                effectively. If my budget was higher, or I was working on a larger project, I may have used a designers
                input, and possibly allocated funds towards that, but to be honest, I was confident in my design
                abilities to move forward with the tools I had.

                <h4>2.3 Assess the strengths and
                    weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review
                    it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? | </h4> I am somewhat
                happy with my final project. In the short amount of time we have had, i.e. four days, I have created a
                complex website with many elements of interactivity. I think it's main weakness lies in the idea. I
                wasn't sure about the idea from the get go and wasn't excited about that side of things, rather I wanted
                to work on the code, and I think the idea side of things fell short. I think it's strengths are its
                layout, and it's modern complexity. There are are decent interactive elements, the page is well laid
                out, and links to different pages, and about the page when its longer with jump links. I have utilised
                my deeper knowledge of front end web develeopment to create a great site - I just wish I had the idea to
                go with it!
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>2.4 Describe further
                    improvements you can make to your project. | </h4> With more time I would improve the site in regard
                to its style, I think there are many modern looking sites out there that are simple and effective, but I
                think I was so pleased with myself for creating the background in CSS using linear gradients, I got far
                too attached to the idea and the design suffered as a resutlt.
                I would make it more reactive, with more
                JavaScript to make it more interactive. I would
                spend more time on the pop up elements of the site, with sub menus in my navbar and floating images. I
                would also add music to my games. I would fix the position of the "8" in he magic eight-ball!

                <h4>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements
                    and are fit for purpose</h4> I believe the outcomes are fit for purpose. It seems to be quite self
                explanatory, and I don't think I've strayed too far off the beaten track. I wanted to create a website
                with good functionality that displayed my progress that I have made thus far in the course. I think I
                have acheived that, and that it suited the outcomes absolutely fine.
