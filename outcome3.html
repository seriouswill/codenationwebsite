                <h3>Outcome 1</h3>
                <p>
                <h4>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and
                    efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done
                    it in teams? | </h4>
                I do not think I could have been more productive overall with my project, and
                if I could have been more productive, It would marginal. I used Trello from the very beginning to
                outline my tasks, their priority and the project direction. I found this incredibly effective and
                helpfl, and as such it kept me wholly on task. The only element of productivity i think I could have
                improved upon is time managment, and I have since found a good application for doing so in <a
                    href="http://https://wheniwork.com/">https://wheniwork.com/</a>. I wish I had found it sooner!
                I don't think VS Code has
                many drawbacks, other than to be able to preview content. A HTML previewer pane, might be an effective
                extension, and I could find none in the extension store that fit my needs. This was alleviated by my use
                of two screens however, as I was able to save changes in VS Code and reload my local file in my browser.
                I definitely think this project could have been done in a team. The reason being, that all the tasks
                were set out from the very start of the project, and updated as I went on. This meant that the roadmap
                was laid out in front of me, and I was raring to go, but so also could a team have been!

                <h4>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency | </h4> I definitely could have been more
                efficient with my time in regard to design, I spent quite a while choosing colours etc. Overall though I
                think I was very productive, I attribute this to my use of Trello and strong work ethic. I took regular
                breaks and kept hydrated. I also ran in the mornings, and did yoga - this helped my thought processess
                stay on track, and stay positive. I also made the use of two screens, this helped massively as I could
                review changes to code on my site as I wrote them effectively.

                <h4>3.3 Develop solutions to
                    improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time?
                    Team work? Use of Slack? | </h4> I was far more efficient on this solo project than in the group
                project, I felt that this was due to the pandemic measures, but slack definitely helped the process. Had
                I to work in a team, the use of github is a must. On this solo project I don't know how much more I
                could have produces, but certainly I could have been more effective swith my design choices, and
                implemented some better time management in that regard. I could use the timer app, or the focusup
                website in order to keep an eye on how much time is being spent on what. That is something that I
                managed ad hoc. Trello helped me stay on task, but in regard to how much time i spent on each task, like
                the JavaScript elements, and the color palllette, I could have spent less time. Overall I don't think I
                could have done much more in the time we had.

                <h4> 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions | </h4> In a longer project I would
                allocate definite days to test different methods and processes, in order to judge how effective they
                are. I would allocate a period at the end of the day to in Trello to evaluate the changes, and see
                whether or not, context and workload aside, they were effective and to be further implemented along the
                pipeline. I would use time managemnt apps, and Trello to track this, and update my results in Trello as
                the project continues.
                I would test further digital solutions by first watching, seeing examples of said solutions in action,
                reading and researching more about them, and using resources like github, stack overflow and the wider
                front end development community (especially on sites like reddit.com - where I have found tons of useful
                info on the /r/webdev subbreddit).
