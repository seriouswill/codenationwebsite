                <h4>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page. | </h4>
                I have a whopping 10 pages in total. They are as follows: My main page which acts as a landing page. Has
                a daft image of my on the front and goes onto describe my idea for the site to give top tips for
                freelance living! I've added in some small fun JavaScript to change some of the text when the mouse
                hovers over this text. Just a bit of fun to have people interested, and so they get the tone of the
                site, that it's fun and a bit silly. For the colour scheme I have used CloudFlare design, Adobe Color
                Studio, and <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coolors.co</a>. I
                initially went with Cloud Flare's style, but found it too polarising. Too much going on for a very text
                heavy website such as this.
                I have an Extras and Easter Eggs page which includes some of my fun python work, like making a programn
                to calculate how late people were to class, and a magic eight ball I made previously.
                I've an About Me page that goes into some small detail about me.
                I have five question pages; one landing page with links, and 4 pages for the outcomes (like this one
                here!).
                I also have a reference page for all the links I used throughout the site.
                As a rule, all links are clickable with no opener no refferer, in order to protect privacy from link
                jacking.
                I have endevoured to make all HTML accessible with alts for the images, but I have yet to explore aria
                for screen readers.
                I have used all o my HTML semtantically, for creen readers and accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints
                    affecting websites. | </h4> I don't have any elements that could come under copyright issue apart
                from the gif I link to of Jack Black. However, I have a copywrite disclaimer, and I also don not host
                any products/assets that could come under copywrite - only links to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues
                    that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them? | </h4>
                As I metnioned, I have used all of my HTML semtantically, for screen readers and accessibility. I used
                asides, main, body, and alts, alongside the standard use of div etc, so that should a person have sight
                difficulties and use a screen reader I have things in place. I am aware of the use of aria for people
                with more advanced sight issues, and I will be implementing that also on the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites? | </h4> I have used a .js file for my
                script page, a .css file for my stylesheet, and .html files for everything else. In regard to the file
                types hosted within the page, I used a .png file for my head icon (the guitar), as its much smaller and
                will not slow the page down. No background images were used, though I know well how to implement them -
                I instead sought the challenge of making a background in pure CSS3 - so no loading issues there either.
                For my twitter links, i used async with them so they load at the same time as the page. There was one
                instance of me using a jpeg file for the About Me image, but i selected it in CSS and use [
                image-rendering: optimizeSpeed;] to make sure it wouldn't slow the page down.
